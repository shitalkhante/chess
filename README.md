# chess

<!-- 1. Write a program that takes the position of a Knight as input on an 8x8

chessboard.
2. Given the position of the Knight, find all the possible places where the Knight can
move. You can assume that there are no pieces of the opposite color and hence no
blocks. -->

for testing you need to provide text file containing space seperrated x and y values for position of knight
